Music Alert App
# Music Alert 

## App Description

Allows those that follow music to stay up to date on when artists are releasing albums or their songs.

## App Idea Evaluation

- **Mobile**: Real time notifications of when albums are released, maybe maps of other users (?)
- **Story**: Allow users to follow information on their favorite artist's releases
- **Market**: Music listeners, followers of music artists
- **Habit**: Check 1-3 times a week to find when things are releasing, receive push notifications when certain artists are releasing music
- **Scope**: release a single genre of music first / release on college campuses because that is a large demographic of music listeners
